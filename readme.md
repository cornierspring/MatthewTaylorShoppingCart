### Readme

The following are some of my thoughts on the project. Please read if you are interested.

For the task I tried to deliver exactly what was in the brief, as opposed to when working with a clint. Where I would likely take a more interpretive understanding especially if dealing with a non technical client. (What the client says they want is not necessarily what they need).

This was my first ever time coding in PHP so the main focus was getting something functional, which I believed to have achieved. I also aimed to make the code of a high standard in terms of code quality such as maintainability, scalability, understandabily, changeability etc. While I believe I have made a valiant attempt, There were just some things I aimed to do that I just couldnt find the answers to alone in the time which I had spent on it. One such example of this is regards to changeability in the future. For instance, if the client of the project decided they would later want pictures along with the price and name, this would not be an easy change to make. (However this is partly a problem with only using html for the frontend, using something more robust like javascript for the front end could influence what can be done on the back end but I chose not to as the html was not going to be marked).

One thing to note about the way I wrote my code, I put things into named functions to follow a philosophy of good code design where the goal is to make the code understandable without the use of comments. So the decision was intentional.

All that being said I am confident that with just a little bit of guidance I would be able to achieve a greater quality project project.

## Points of Feedback I am particularly interested in:

- How does my program fare performance-wise? I used a lot of loops so even if it runs adequately, I know there is room for improvement somehow.

- Did I break conventions? One thing I suspected might not be good coding practise is writing html in php and echoing it out (however I still did this as it was the only way I knew to not hard code everything in html).

- Are there any other glaring flaws in my code?

## How to run

(I am confident you have your own means of running it but I'll detail how I got it to run in case there are errors).

1. Install and run Wampserver.

2. locate the index.php file to "C:\wamp64\www\MatthewTaylorShoppingCart"

3. Open a browser and type: "localhost/MatthewTaylorShoppingCart/index.php"
